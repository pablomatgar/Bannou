# Bannou (万能)

Swift-based IOS app developed at [HackUPC 2019](https://2019.hackupc.com), the first student hackathon in Spain (fifth edition, at Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Barcelona).

The purpose of developing this app was trying to create a system that allows Spanish tourists who go to Japan and vice versa to use the following functionalities:

- Use a Spanish-Japanese dictionary.
- Use a Romanji (Roman alphabet) - Hiragana/Katakana (Japanese syllabaries) translator.
- Access to travel information.
- Access to recommendations.

Bannou(万能) means all-purpose and we thought it could describe the purpose of the app clearly.

This app was developed by myself and with the help of two Japanese guys men supported me by translating the app.

*Due to the short amount of time, we could only complete some basic functionalities.
